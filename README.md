# Loyalty Prediction Model

## Project Overview
This project is a web application designed to predict the loyalty score of relatives based on several input features such as frequency of communication, help in crises, financial support, attendance at events, and sentiment score. The application uses a machine learning model to make predictions and provides an interactive user interface built with React.js.

## Features
- Input fields for user data related to loyalty metrics.
- Predicts loyalty scores based on user input.
- Displays results using toast notifications for a better user experience.
- Built with a Flask backend to serve the machine learning model.
